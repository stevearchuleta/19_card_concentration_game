# Steve Archuleata Educational Tutorial for a REACT Card Memory Game - UC DAVIS / Trilogy Week 19 HW 

## Building a REACT Card Memory Game

Building a REACT card memory game, where flower images are displayed on the screen and as the user 'flips' them, two at a time, if there is a match, the cards stay face up. If not, they revert after a couple of seconds to face down and the game continues until the user gets all the matches.

### The following technologies and techniques are used to build this app.

- React (of course)
- Hooks
  - state
  - effects
- setTimeout
- CSS keyframes

### This educational tutorial has been divided into chapters using git-banches. This helps Steve Archuleta better understand the modularized build of a react app using git-branches.
