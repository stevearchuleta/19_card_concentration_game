Clicky Game


Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a memory game with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.


Submission on BCS



This assignment must be deployed. * Please submit both the deployed GitHub Pages link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!



Instructions


Check out the example solution and study the app's basic functionality.
Create a new React application using Create React App.
The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.
The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.

# Steve Archuleata Educational Tutorial for a REACT Card Memory Game - UC DAVIS / Trilogy Week 19 HW 

## Building a REACT Card Memory Game

Building a REACT card memory game, where flower images are displayed on the screen and as the user 'flips' them, two at a time, if there is a match, the cards stay face up. If not, they revert after a couple of seconds to face down and the game continues until the user gets all the matches.

### The following technologies and techniques are used to build this app.

- React (of course)
- Hooks
  - state
  - effects
- setTimeout
- CSS keyframes

### This educational tutorial has been divided into chapters using git-banches. This helps Steve Archuleta better understand the modularized build of a react app using git-branches.
